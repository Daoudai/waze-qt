 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *   This module handles the "http://[...]" URLs for the map download
 *   feature of RoadMap. This module is designed to be linked to RoadMap
 *   either statically or dynamically. In the later case, the following
 *   linker option should be used when creating the shared library on Linux:
 *
 *       --defsym roadmap_plugin_init=roadmap_httpcopy_init
 *
 * BUGS:
 *
 *   This module make explicit references to the roadmap_file module,
 *   which prevents it from being built as a plugin.
