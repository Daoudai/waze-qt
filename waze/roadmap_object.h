 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *   This module manages a dynamic list of objects to be displayed on the map.
 *   The objects are usually imported from external applications for which
 *   a RoadMap driver has been installed (see roadmap_driver.c).
 *
 *   These objects are dynamic and not persistent (i.e. these are not points
 *   of interest).
 *
 *   It is possible for a module to register a listener function for
 *   a specific object, i.e. to get a listener function to be called
 *   each time the object has moved. The registration will fail (return
 *   NULL) if the object could not be found. A valid listener address is
 *   always returned if the registration is successful.
 *
 *   It is also possible to monitor the creation and deletion of objects.
 *   Combined with the listener registration, this makes it possible for
 *   a module to listen to a specific object when it is created, or register
 *   again when it is deleted and then re-created.
 *
 *   Listeners and monitors must be linked to each other in a daisy-chain
 *   fashion, i.e. each listener (monitor) must call the listener (monitor)
 *   that was declared before itself.
 *
 *   This module is self-initializing and can be used at any time during
 *   the initialization of RoadMap.
