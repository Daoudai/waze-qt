 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *   This module provides a simple interface for launching a help tool.
 *
 *   The basic concept is that the help tool supports a short list of topics
 *   represented each by an index string and a label. The typical help tool
 *   is a web browser.
 *
 *   The functions roadmap_help_topic_first and roadmap_help_topic_next
 *   help build the user interface (for example a list of menu entries).
